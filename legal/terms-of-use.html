However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these terms as a court would.</p><p class="text-14 lg:text-16 text-grey">The arbitration may be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA&#x27;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA&#x27;s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</p><p class="text-14 lg:text-16 text-grey">We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.
